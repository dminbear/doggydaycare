# Doggy Daycare Database System

### UBC CPSC 304 Intro to Databases Project 

In collaboration with Sophia Chen, Vincent Tsai and Daniel Kim (Winter 2016) 

## Description of what the project accomplished

We managed to get most of the GUI functioning and a working console version. 
The queries we had planned were implemented. Customers have a fairly elaborate UI to work with. We managed to get error handling to work for certain functions particularly for customer inputs (such as not allowing empty text fields or invalid types to be submitted into the database).

We gained an appreciation for the difficulties that arise in certain group situations. Sometimes it is very difficult to communicate with one another about certain functionalities that we want from each other. There are always going to be schedule conflicts, miscommunication and disagreements about pretty much anything, but overcoming such obstacles is what makes each and every one of the members of this group become better programmers.
